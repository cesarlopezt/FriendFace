# FriendFace
FriendFace is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that allows you to fetch a list of friends from an API, display them in a list, and view detailed information about each friend. The app also shows nested friends, where you can explore the friends of your friends. Additionally, the app caches the friend data using Core Data to provide offline access. This app was made as the challenge of Days 60 and 61 from 100 Days of SwiftUI.
